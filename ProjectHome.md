`TuneIn Tools` is a collection of utilities to make it easier to build apps which use `TuneIn`, a comprehensive radio directory and API.

So far, this project includes:
  * a `JavaScript` library which uses `TuneIn's` OPML/JSON API including
    * documentation, example code
    * convenience functions for search, browse, audio playback, and scheduling
    * audio playback support under Flash, HTML5 (iPad only), CE-HTML, and Songbird.
  * a UI-less flash player
